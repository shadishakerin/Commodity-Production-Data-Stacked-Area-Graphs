# Commodity-Production-Data-Stacked-Area-Graphs

In this repository first I create a panel dataset containing the production of all countries, the dataset is created using the raw data downloaded in csv format from the link: https://clio-infra.eu/#. Afterwards I create two stacked area graphs, for production of copper in the first 30 countries in the sample and then for all the countries between 1950 to 2012. To replicate the study create a directory and paste the data folder in it after downloading. Create another folder and name it "graphs". Finally paste the do-file in your directory. Update "path" in line 6 and run the do-file. 
Note that you need to install the necessary packages as explained in lines 36-45 according to your current version of Stata.
